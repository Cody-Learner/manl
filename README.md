# manl (rewrite Aug 8, 2019)<br>

Manl combines a manpage, prepended with your personal notes in a CLI or GUI editor.			<br>
Makes it convenient to create/edit and save new/edited notes while reviewing manpages.			<br>
Automatically seperates notes from manpage and saves notes to ~/.manl/\<manpage name\>.			<br>

Copy/paste in an editor, information from manpages, add content, save to your notes.			<br>
File name  and path  are preset by manl, just save your changes.					<br>
Next time you use manl <manpage>, your notes will be printed above the manpage.				<br>

Usage:													<br>

manl \<manpage\>											<br>

notes saved as same as ~/.manl/\<manpage name\>								<br>
